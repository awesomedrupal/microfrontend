## Overview

This microfrontend App has four Apps: 
- [Host](localhost:8080)
- [MarketPlace](localhost:8081) 
- [Authentication](localhost:8082)
- [Home](localhost:8083)
    

Microfrontends enable independent development of individual components, allowing teams to work autonomously on different parts of the application.


## Getting Started

- 1. Do npm install in each of the above apps
- 2. Do npm start in each of the above apps

## Usage

Use http://localhost:8080 to access the container or host application.


## Testing

I have not written Unit or E2E tests for this app

## Deployment

I have incorporated GitHub workflows if you want to deploy to any AWS environment where you have admin access on S3 and Cloud Front.
